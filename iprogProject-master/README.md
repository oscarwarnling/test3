## Flag Game!

Our idea is to create a geography game consisting of primarily guessing flags. The game will have two different game modes. One is guessing a flag with four country options. The other one is to pick the correct country from a map given a flag. 
The vision is for the player to be able to pick a difficulty level and continents. 
A score will also be stored.

## What we've done

So far we've implemented the skeleton and are working on the gameplay logic for guess the flag (21. march).

the public directory contains the index.html that gets deployed. 
Under src, the Components directory contains all the react components for the UI.


## What we still plan to do

First of all we want to finish implementing both gameplays. Then move on to more permanent storage for high scores and such. We will do some code refactoring continuously for improvements as we go along.

## To run
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
